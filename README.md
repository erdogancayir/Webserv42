# Webserv42
This project is here to make you write your own HTTP server. You will be able to test it with a real browser. HTTP is one of the most used protocol on internet. Knowing its arcane will be useful, even if you won't be working on a website. 
This is when you finally understand why a URL starts
with HTTP

```  make ``` 

```  ./webserv config/ ```
